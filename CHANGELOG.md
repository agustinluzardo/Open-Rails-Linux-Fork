# Riel Linux changelog

Stable versions and their assets are available in
[Releases](https://github.com/agustinluzardo/Riel-Linux/releases). `main-<commit>` builds are
prereleases that passed automated tests and packaging.

## 0.1.8

- Keeps the complete player train loaded when switching cameras between the ends of a
  long consist. Previously, the opposite end could be unloaded on a curve and nearby
  vehicles then disappeared while their models were loaded again.
- Reproduces the USA2/autotrnsetout loader failure with positions captured by the 0.1.7
  visibility trace, and checks repeated camera changes through the production loader.
- Detached cars and other trains continue to stream by distance. Normal shape culling,
  detail selection, camera snapshots and MSTS track placement are preserved.
- Confirmation with the original route on the user's NVIDIA GPU remains pending.

## 0.1.7

- Uses the prepared frame's camera position for scenery-shader fog, specular lighting
  and distance fading, completing the camera snapshot introduced in 0.1.5.
- Prevents blended materials from fading out when the updater moves the live camera
  across a tile while the previous frame is being drawn.
- Adds opt-in **Train visibility diagnostics** in Settings → Advanced. It records actual
  model detail selection, culling, mesh submission and vehicle transforms in the simulator log.
- Preserves the three-dimensional MSTS track placement from 0.1.6. Confirmation that this
  fixes all reported intermittent vehicle disappearances on the original MSTS route is pending.

## 0.1.6

- Applies all three MSTS placement angles (yaw, pitch and roll) to imported endpoints and
  runtime positions, matching Open Rails' three-dimensional track displacement.
- Fixes track sections being flattened at their starting height, which made wheels jump
  between elevations and raised or steeply tilted cars at section joins.
- Uses a cached section orientation for traversal and a placed three-dimensional curve
  basis for snapping, including zero-height PAT points and horizontal diagnostics.
- Repairs positions of track items reconstructed from section distances with the same geometry.
- Computes runtime endpoints from placement angles even when an older route model contains
  flattened endpoints; the version update also refreshes available source-backed content.
- Finds signal shapes by each head's global TDB identity, avoiding wrong-head selection and
  out-of-range local reference lookups after reference changes or multi-head merging.
- Adds regressions for import, traveller movement, graded curves, tile boundaries, cached
  endpoints and real wheel-based car placement in both directions, plus signal-shape lookup.
- Includes the previous rendering and startup fixes. Native editor code is unchanged.
- The reported original MSTS route and NVIDIA hardware still need a user-side confirmation.

## 0.1.5

- Keeps each prepared frame's camera view and projection matrices instead of reading a
  camera that the updater may already be moving for the next frame.
- Uses the same captured camera for opaque and blended render passes, shadow direction
  and distant mountains, including changes of field of view or projection.
- Adds regression tests for concurrent frame preparation, tile-sized camera movement,
  projection changes, distant mountains and the loading screen.
- Includes the startup crash fixes from 0.1.4. The native editors are unchanged.
- Fixes a verified rendering race; confirmation that it resolves the reported black
  flashes on the user's route and GPU remains pending.

## 0.1.4

- Fixes `SunMoonPos.SolarAngle` startup crashes when an ENV file has no recognized sun,
  including an empty satellite light/type block. Uses the existing astronomical fallback
  and preserves configured sunrise/sunset times.
- Fixes `SignalEnvironment.InsertNode` startup crashes when an unplaced speedpost keeps
  a signal index that becomes invalid after multi-head signals are merged.
- Prevents unplaced speedposts from reusing another signal's speed restriction; records
  unsuccessful placement in the log while retaining correctly placed signals and posts.
- Adds regression tests using the production sky calculation, ENV parser, signal scanner,
  head merging and track-circuit insertion.
- Includes the editor and Vulkan updates from 0.1.3, with expanded English documentation
  and explicit TSRE5vc credits to Piotr Gadecki (GokuMK).
- Reported black flashes during gameplay remain under investigation.

## 0.1.3

### Editor suite

- Integrates native Route Editor, Consist Editor, Shape Viewer and ACE Converter, based on
  **TSRE5vc by Piotr Gadecki (GokuMK)**, with their runtime, icons and corresponding source.
- Opens the route and content folder selected in the launcher and uses its own settings profile.
- Fixes memory corruption caused by concurrent writes to the editor log.
- Validates DDS dimensions and pixel data before decoding; truncated files are rejected.
- Resolves mixed-case references, split `GLOBAL`/`Global` directories, X/Y Tracks, route models
  and textures.
- Bounds directory caching and texture workers while preserving model identity and texture context.
- Fixes OpenGL startup, resources, consist selection and ACE preview zoom.
- Checks real main windows, models and GPU-uploaded textures; verifies decoders and concurrent
  logging with sanitizers.

### Simulator and launcher

- Activates experimental Vulkan from Settings in the native environment before context creation;
  the OpenGL renderer runs through Mesa Zink.
- F3 reports the active renderer and available CPU/GPU temperatures.
- Expands settings and diagnostics and adds access to the editor suite.
- Rescans content at launcher startup and avoids repeating the scan after a session.
- Keeps track-monitor signals and limits within the visible range.

### Known status

- Zink remains experimental and does not change the editors' renderer.
- Multiplayer has no validated flow from the Linux launcher.
- Black flashes during gameplay remain under investigation.
- In FCGR, the signal between Quilmes and Ezpeleta can appear green while being treated as red.
- Add-ons built against `FreeTrainSimulator.*` require adaptation to `Riel.*`.
  Older-save compatibility has not been fully verified.

## 0.1.2

- Fixes emitter ring-buffer indexing and restores the 80-byte particle vertex stride.
- Recovers dynamic particle buffers invalidated by DesktopGL.
- Fixes the DesktopGL billboard shader so smoke, steam and other emitters do not collapse
  into zero-area polygons.
- Adds particle and diesel exhaust diagnostics in Settings.

## 0.1.1

- Applies an intermediate OpenGL particle vertex-layout fix.
- The complete billboard correction follows in 0.1.2.

## 0.1.0

- First stable Riel Linux release, with the .NET runtime included.
- Renames public libraries to `Riel.*` and adapts the launcher and updates.
- Hardens activity testing to record startup failures and continue the batch.
- Improves nearby AI train visual loading and adds diagnostics.
- Adds F3 system information and Linux temperature reporting.
